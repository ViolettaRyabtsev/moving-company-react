    "body": "Luis and Miguel did an excellent job! They were both very professional, courteous and on-time. Strong, like two Vikings, the two made my move from an upstairs apartment look like a breeze. I gave them both instructions only once at the beginning of the move and then I sat back and relaxed while they did all the work. Luis and Miguel remembered everything I instructed with no need for me to repeat myself. They used their professional experience to move items quickly and efficiently. This is the second time I have used Viking, and I'll surely use them again! They are the moving heroes!  - Thank you Viking!"
